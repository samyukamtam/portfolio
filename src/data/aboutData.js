    description1: "My name's Samyu. I'm a robotics and software engineer. I am interested in Medical robotic technollogy and intelligent systems.",
    description2: "I’m an engineer who believes technology should make life easier, more accessible, and more human. My work sits at the intersection of robotics, AI, and real-world problem solving, with a strong focus on medical and assistive systems. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Mechatronics and Robotics at NYU, where I work across research labs, startups, and multidisciplinary teams to take ideas from concept to reality. I enjoy taking ownership, leading initiatives, and building thoughtfully designed systems that balance technical depth with meaningful application.\n\nBeyond engineering, I’m deeply creative and people-driven. I’m a professional classical dancer, photographer, and someone who finds inspiration outdoorsm experiences that shape how I think, design, and lead. I’m motivated by helping people, drawn to problems where engineering meets empathy, and grounded in the belief that the best solutions are built with intention, creativity, and care.",
